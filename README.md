# StaffDirectoryApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.6.

I  followed the [Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) from Angular's documentation to complete the app.

## How to use Staff Directory 

You can add/edit/delete staff from the Dashboard page, the Staff Members page, or by searching for a staff member in the Staff Search bar. Your actions are tracked in the history section, which can be cleared at any time.
